This folder contains ```REDSEA-py``` the translated version of ```REDSEA-matlab``` in python and should perform the same.

However, certain helper functions are not available in the python code, eg. the sanity check plots and production of fcs files. These can be added by the user if needed.

The python code runs under ```python=3.6```, and the necessary packages are in the ```req.txt```

NOTE: this code is not extensively benchmarked, thus please notify us if user see anything abnormal.
