    "Edited substantially and re-organized from the original REDSEA python version 0.0.1 file in this folder (see that file for details on the original python version).\n",
    "\n",
    "Edited by Ben Caiello, with the intent of allowing it to work with current DeepCell segmentation masks / the steinbock pipeline. The algorithm is not identical, as that is not possible (I think) given the differenes in the masks of old DeepCell and new DeepCell (+ / - zero boundaries changes the effective pixel width of the boundary measurement step).\n",

    "\n",
    "The directory structure required for the script as-written is the one naturally produced by steinbock:\n",
    "\n",
    "A master directory with two folders: \\img & \\masks - each containing .tiffs with the original images and the DeepCell generated masks, repectively, with matching file names - and 1 .csv file (panel.csv). These are all naturally produced by steinbock when it is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script has not been thoroughly tested, but should produce outputs and seems to be doing what it is supposed to with the limited testing so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some (potential and certain) differences in the algorithm to note:\n",
    "    1. Since the masks format is different with DeepCell now (no cell-cell padding with 0's), the algorithm is made to find border px by looking for >1 segmentation label (indicating >1 cell or cell + background boundary)\n",
    "    2. Also, because of the lack of padding, the effective distances and sizes of the diamond / square boder px identification step is altered"
